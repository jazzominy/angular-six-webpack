Here is webpack configuration for building/compiling angular project without using angular-cli

### Steps to run the project

* First clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/jazzominy/angular-six-webpack.git`
* Run `npm i` or `yarn`
* Run `npm run build:dll` to generate `vendor.dll.js`
* Once above script runs successfully, run `npm start`
* This should run the app at `localhost:8080` if there are no build errors

This is a very simple webpack config to build angular project. You are free to add your own webpack plugins depending on your requirements
